# Tic-Tac-Toe
Trying to design an algorithm for a Tic-Tac-Toe game in C, Javascript, Python.
I am interested in making a real complete project as I learn the programming languages.

## C
Completed.
I was having trouble with the menu option before but got help from a friend. 

## Javascript
Just started doing it, my first ever Javascript project. I'm trying not to use any tutorials and do all the coding myself.

## Python
I will start the Python project once I complete the Javascript code.

=================================================================================


Planning to add Java and React code as I make my way towards these languages.
