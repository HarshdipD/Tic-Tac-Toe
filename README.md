# Tic-Tac-Toe
Trying to design an algorithm for a Tic-Tac-Toe game in C, Javascript, Python.
I am interested in making a real complete project as I learn the programming languages.

## C
Completed.
I was having trouble with the menu option before but got help from a friend.

## Python
Completed. This was my first python project. Planning to work more on this language.

## Javascript
Just started doing it, my first ever Javascript project. I'm trying not to use any tutorials and do all the coding myself.

Planning to add Java and React code as I make my way towards these languages.
