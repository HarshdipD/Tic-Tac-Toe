# Tic-Tac-Toe
Trying to design an algorithm for a Tic-Tac-Toe game in C, Javascript, Python.
I am interested in making a real complete project as I learn the programming languages.

## C
I added the menu in the latest commit, but it doesn't seem to work after one try. I'll fix that back in some time.

## Javascript
Just started doing it, my first ever Javascript project. I'm trying not to use any tutorials and do all the coding myself.

## Python
I will start the Python project once I complete the Javascript code and fix the C issue.

=================================================================================


Planning to add Java and React code as I make my way towards these languages.
