# Tic-Tac-Toe
Designing algorithms for a Tic-Tac-Toe game in C, Java, Python, and more.
I am interested in making a real complete project as I learn the programming languages.

## C
Completed.
I was having trouble with the menu option before but got help from a friend.

## Python
Completed. This was my first python project. Planning to work more on this language someday!

## Java
In progress! I am taking an object oriented approach here, and I plan to learn AI and implement it in this game!

## React
Following the tutorial provided by React docs!

## Javascript
Just started doing it, my first ever Javascript project. I'm trying not to use any tutorials and do all the coding myself.
